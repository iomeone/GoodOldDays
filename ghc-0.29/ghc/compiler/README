This directory contains the source for Glorious Glasgow Haskell
compiler proper, normally a binary called "hsc".  The source is
organized into _one_ level of directories, and the literate Haskell
source files sit in those directories (i.e., */*.lhs).

The only "real" subdirectory is the tests/ directory [NB: not
distributed normally, but available to gluttons for punishment], which
includes some tests that we use to make sure we're not going
backwards.  The subdirs of the test directory "match" the subdirs of
the main source directory; e.g., the desugarer is in subdir deSugar/,
and the tests for the desugarer are in tests/deSugar/.

The main information about how the compiler goes together is in
./Jmakefile.  The list of modules under "FRONTSRCS_LHS =", 
"TCSRCS_LHS =", etc., should show the basic organization of the (many)
modules.

TO ADD A MODULE TO THE COMPILER:

0. Be familiar with "How to add an optimisation pass..." (in
   ghc/docs/add_to_compiler).

1. Create an appropriately-named module in an appropriate subdirectory.

2. Edit the Jmakefile:

   * If you created a new subdirectory for the module, add that
     directory to the SUBDIR_LIST and DASH_I_SUBDIR_LIST lists.

   * Add your module to one of the lists of modules in the compiler;
     e.g., TCSRCS_LHS.

3. Re-make the Makefile: "make Makefile"

4. Re-make the automatically-generated dependencies: "make depend".

Your new module is now "wired in" and you may proceed normally...

    % make

(see also: day-to-day make-worlding section of developer's guide, near
the end)

5.  If you want to set up automagically (re-)runnable tests, follow
    the suggests in the file tests/README.
