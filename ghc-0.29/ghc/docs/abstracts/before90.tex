{Generating Function Versions with Rational Strictness Patterns}
{Science of Computer Programming 12 (1989)}
{Expression evaluation in lazy applicative languages is usually implemented
by an expensive mechanism requiring time and space which may be wasted
if the expression eventually needs the values anyway. Strictness analysis,
which has been successfully applied to flat domains and higher order functions,
is used here to annotate programs in a first order language containing
lazy list constructors so that they retain their original behavior, but
run more efficiently. In practice, the strictness in fields within these
constructors often follows regular patterns that can be finitely
represented, especially in programs that manipulate such useful structures
as finite or infinite trees. The approach presented here typically generates
efficient, mutually recursive function versions for these programs.
Weak and strong safety are defined and discussed, and the compiler
is shown to be weakly safe. Termination is guaranteed by several factors,
including a finite resource which controls the increase in code size,
and a regularity constraint placed upon the strictness patterns
propagated during compilation.}

{Exception Handling in a Parallel Functional Language: PSML}
{Proc TENCON '89, Bombay, India, Nov 1989}
{
Handling exception occurrences during computation is a problem  in  most
functional programming languages, even when the computation is eager and
sequential.  This paper presents a version of  the  error  value  method
which  allows lazy computation with deterministic semantics for parallel
evaluation even in the presence of  errors.   The  realisation  of  this
technique   is   illustrated  by  reference  to  PSML,  a  referentially
transparent variant of Standard ML designed for parallel evaluation.

{Improving list comprehension database queries}
{{\em TENCON '89\/} (IEEE Region 10 Conference),
Bombay, India, November 1989.}
{
The task of increasing the efficiency of database queries has recieved
considerable attention. In this paper we describe the improvement of
queries expressed as list comprehensions in a lazy functional
language. The database literature identifies four algebraic and two
implementation-based improvement strategies. For each strategy we show
an equivalent improvement for queries expressed as list
comprehensions.  This means that well-developed database algorithms
that improve queries using several of these strategies can be emulated
to improve comprehension queries.  We are also able to improve queries
which require greater power than that provided by the relational
algebra.  Most of the improvements entail transforming a simple,
inefficient query into a more complex, but more efficient form. We
illustrate each improvement using examples drawn from the database
literature.

{The Spineless Tagless G-machine}
{Proc IFIP Symposium on Functional Programming Languages and Computer
Architecture, London, Sept 1989}
{
The Spineless Tagless G-machine is an abstract machine based on graph
reduction, designed as a target for compilers for non-strict functional
languages.
As its name implies, it is a development of earlier work, especially
the G-machine and Tim.

It has a number of unusual features: the abstract machine code is
rather higher-level than is common, allowing better code generation;
the representation of the graph eliminates most interpretive overheads;
vectored returns from data structures give fast case-analysis;
and the machine is readily extended for a parallel implementation.

The resulting implementation runs at least 75\% faster 
than the Chalmers G-machine.

{Implementing Type Classes for Haskell}
{Proc Glasgow  Workshop  on  Functional  Programming,  Fraserburgh, Aug 1989}
{
This  paper describes the implementation of the type class mechanism for
the functional language Haskell, which has been  undertaken  at  Glasgow
University.  A simple introduction to type classes discusses the methods
used to  select  operators  and  dictionaries  in  the  Glasgow  Haskell
compiler.    A   solution   to  the  problem  of  selecting  super-class
dictionaries, not considered by the original paper  on  type  class,  is
also  presented.   The  modifications which must be made to the standard
Hindley/Milner type-checking algorithm  to  permit  the  translation  of
operators  are  described,  and  a  revised definition of algorithm W is
provided. Finally, a set of performance figures  compares  the  run-time
efficiency of Haskell and LML programs, indicating the overhead inherent
in the original, naive method of operator selection, and the improvement
which may be obtained through simple optimisations.

{SIGPLAN Notices 23(8) 1988, revised 1989}

FLIC is a Functional Language Intermediate Code, intended to
provide a common intermediate language between diverse
implementations of functional languages, including parallel
ones.
This paper gives a formal definition of FLIC's syntax and
semantics, in the hope that its existence may encourage greater
exchange of programs and benchmarks between research groups.

{High-performance parallel graph reduction}
{Proc Parallel Architectures and Languages Europe (PARLE), LNCS 365, pp193-207, 
July 1989}
{
Parallel graph reduction is an attractive implementation for functional 
programming languages because of its simplicity and inherently distributed
nature.
This paper outlines some of the issues raised by parallel compiled
graph reduction, and presents the solutions we have adopted to produce an
efficient implementation.

We concentrate on two particular issues:
the efficient control of parallelism, resulting in an ability to alter
the granularity of parallelism 
{\em dynamically};
and the efficient use of the memory hierachy to improve locality.

{Parallel implementations of functional programming languages}
{Computer Journal 32(2), pp175-186, April 1989}
{
It is now very nearly as easy to build a parallel computer
as to build a sequential one, and there are strong incentives to do so:
parallelism seems to offer the opportunity to improve both the 
absolute performance level and the cost/performance ratio of our machines.

One of the most attractive features of functional programming languages
is their suitability for programming such parallel computers.
This paper is devoted to a discussion of this claim.

First of all, we discuss parallel functional programming
from the programmer's point of view.
Most parallel functional language implementations are based on graph reduction,
we proceed to a discussion of some implementation issues raised by parallel 
graph reduction.
The paper concludes with a case study of a particular parallel graph reduction
machine, GRIP, and a brief survey of other similar machines.

{How to make {\em ad-hoc\/} polymorphism less {\em ad hoc}}
{{\em 16'th ACM Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages},
Austin, Texas, January 1989.}
{
This paper presents {\em type classes}, a new approach to {\em
ad-hoc\/} polymorphism.  Type classes permit overloading of arithmetic
operators such as multiplication, and generalise the ``eqtype variables''
of Standard ML.
Type classes extend the Hindley\X Milner polymorphic type system, and
provide a new approach to issues that arise in object-oriented
programming, bounded type quantification, and abstract data types.
This paper provides an informal introduction to type classes, and
defines them formally by means of type inference rules.

{A safe approach to parallel combinator reduction}
{Theoretical Computer Science 56, pp17-36, North Holland, 1988}
{
In this paper we present the results of two pieces of work which, when
combined, allow us to take a program text of a functional langauge and
produce a parallel implementation of that program.
We present the techniques for discovering sources of parallelism in 
a program at compile time, and then show how this parallelism is
naturally mapped onto a parallel combinator set that we will define.

To discover sources of parallelism in a program, we use 
{\em abstract interpretation} a compile-time technique which is used
to gain information about a program which may then be used to optimise
the program's execution.
A particular use of abstract interpretation is in 
{\em strictness analysis}
of functional program.
In a language that has lazy semantics, the main potential for parallelism
arises in the evaluation of arguments of strict operators.

Having identified the sources of parallelism at compile time, it is 
necessary to communicate these to the run-time system.
In the second part of the paper we introduce an extended set of combinators,
including some parallel combinators, to achieve this purpose.

{Debugging in Applicative Languages}
{Lisp and Symbolic Computation, 1988}
{Applicative programming languages have several properties that appear
to make debugging difficult. First, the absence of assignment
statements complicates the notion of changing a program while
debugging. Second, the absence of imperative input and output
makes it harder to obtain information about what the program is doing.
Third, the presence of lazy evaluation prevents the user from
knowing much about the order in which events occur. Some solutions to
these problems involve nonapplicative extensions to the language.
Fortunately, the same features of applicative languages that cause
problems for traditional debugging also support an idiomatic 
applicative style of programming, and effective debugging techniques
can be implemented using that style. This paper shows how to implement
tracing and interactive debugging tools in a purely applicative
style. This approach is more flexible, extensive and portable
than debugging tools that require modification to the language
implementation.}

{Functional programming on the GRIP multiprocessor}
{Proc IEE Seminar on Digital Parallel Processors, Lisbon, Portugal, 1988}
{
Most MIMD computer architectures can be classified as 
tightly-coupled or loosely-coupled,
depending on the relative latencies seen by a processor accessing different
parts of its address space.

By adding microprogrammable functionality to the memory units, we have
developed a MIMD computer architecture which explores the middle region
of this spectrum.
This has resulted in an unusual and flexible bus-based multiprocessor,
which we are using as a base for our research in parallel functional programming
languages.

In this paper we introduce parallel functional programming, and describe
the architecture of the GRIP multiprocessor.

{The spineless G-machine}
{Proc ACM Conference on Lisp and Functional Programming, Snowbird, pp244-258,
August 1988}
{
Recent developments in functional language implementations have
resulted in the G-machine, a programmed graph-reduction machine.
Taking this as a basis, we introduce an optimised method of
performing graph reduction, which does not need to build the
spine of the expression being reduced.
This Spineless G-machine only updates shared expressions, and
then only when they have been reduced to weak head normal form.
It is thus more efficient than the standard method of performing
graph reduction.

We begin by outlining the philosophy and key features of the
Spineless G-machine, and comparing it with the standard
G-machine.
Simulation results for the two machines are then presented and
discussed.

The Spineless G-machine is also compared with Tim, giving a
series of transformations by which they can be interconverted.
These open up a wide design space for abstract graph reduction
machines, which was previously unknown.

A full specification of the machine is given in the appendix,
together with compilation rules for a simple functional language.

{Finding fixpoints in abstract interpretation} 
{in Abstract Interpretation of Declarative Languages,
ed Hankin \& Abramsky, Ellis Horwood, pp246-265, 1987.}
{
Abstract interpretation is normally used as the basis for
a static, compile-time analysis of a program.
For example, strictness analysis attempts to establish which
functions in the program are strict (we will use strictness
analysis as a running example).

Using abstract interpretation in this way requires the
compile-time evaluation of expressions in the abstract domain.
It is obviously desirable that this evaluation should
always terminate, since otherwise the compiler would risk
non-termination.
In the case of non-recursive functions there is no problem, and
termination is guaranteed.
Recursive functions, however, present more of a problem, and it
is the purpose of this paper to explain the problem and to
offer some practical solutions.

GRIP is a high-performance parallel machine designed to execute
functional programs using supercombinator graph reduction.
It uses a high-bandwidth bus to provide access to a
large, distributed shared memory, using intelligent memory units and
packet-switching protocols to increase the number of processors
which the bus can support.
GRIP is also being programmed to support parallel Prolog and
DACTL.

We outline GRIP's architecture and firmware, discuss the major design
issues, and describe the current state of the project and

{Implementing Pattern-Matching Functional Languages using Dactl}
{University of Glasgow, 1989}
{
This paper describes the implementation of a family of  pattern-matching
functional  languages  in  the  parallel graph-rewriting language Dactl.
Attention  is   focussed   on   the   direct   implementation   of   the
pattern-matching   constructs   in  the  context  of  various  reduction
strategies: eager, lazy, and lazy with  strictness  analysis.   Two  new
reduction  strategies  combining  lazy  evaluation  with a technique for
compiling non-overlapping patterns are  also  illustrated.   The  latter
strategies   provide   improved  termination  properties  compared  with
conventional functional  language  implementations  for  non-overlapping
patterns.  The implementations described here cover all pattern-matching
constructs found in Standard  ML,  including  named  patterns  and  deep
patterns.   The  use  of  Dactl  renders  explicit  the  complexities of
pattern-matching which are obscured by implementation in a  conventional
intermediate language or abstract machine.
