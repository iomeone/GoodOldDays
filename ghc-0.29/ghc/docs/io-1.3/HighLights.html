<h2>Highlights</h2>

Here are the highlights of the 1.3 I/O definition.
<ul>
<li>
We define a <em>monadic programming model</em>
(see <A href="Biblio.html#cupitt89">Cupitt 89</a>,
<a href="Biblio.html#wadler-essence">Wadler 92</a>,
<a href="Biblio.html#gordon92">Gordon 92</a>,
<A href="Biblio.html#peytonjones93">Peyton Jones 93</a>,
<a href="Biblio.html#launchbury94">Launchbury 94</a>,
and the bibliographies of
these papers). Expressions of type
<code>IO</code> <var>a</var> denote computations that may engage in I/O before
returning an answer of type <var>a</var>.
<li>
The <code>IO</code> monad admits computations that fail and recovery from
such failures.
<li>
We propose a new type of <em>handles</em>, to mediate character I/O on
both files and channels.
<li>
We propose input polling and input of characters.  Haskell 1.2
represented character input as a single <code>String</code> (that is, a lazy
list of characters), containing all the characters available for input
throughout the program run.
<li>
Our proposal supports the majority of Haskell 1.2 I/O operations.
We judged it too complex to support them all.
<li>
We provide an extensible framework for future Haskell implementations, built on
existing I/O standards and common operating system practice.
</ul>

Monadic programming models have proved to be more general and in many
respects simpler than the stream-based I/O system used in Haskell 1.2.
Several implementations exist.  This document is intended to be a
relatively conservative standard to allow programs to be ported
between the various Haskell systems.  <p>
