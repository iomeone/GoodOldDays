<h2>Standard I/O "PreludeStdIO"</h2>


This module defines Haskell <em>handles</em> and the operations which
are supported for them.<p>

Haskell interfaces to the external world through an abstract <em>file
system</em>.  This file system is a collection of named <em>file
system objects</em>, which may be organised
in <em>directories</em> (see <a href="LibDirectory.html"><code>LibDirectory</code></a>).  
In some implementations, directories may themselves be file system
objects and could be entries in other directories.  For simplicity,
any non-directory file system object is termed a <em>file</em>,
although it could in fact be a communication channel, or any other
object recognised by the operating system.  <em>Physical files</em> are
persistent, ordered files, and normally reside on disk.<p>

File and directory names are values of type <code>String</code>, whose
precise meaning is operating system dependent.  Files can be opened,
yielding a handle which can then be used to operate on the contents
of that file.<p>

<a name="Handles"><h3>Handles</h3></a>


The standard defines operations to read/write finite sequences of
items from/to files, represented by values of type
<code>Handle</code>.  Each value of this type is a <em>handle</em>: a
record used by the Haskell run-time system to <em>manage</em> I/O with
operating system objects.<p>

A handle has at least the following properties:
<ul>
<li> whether it manages input or output or both;
<li> whether it is <em>open</em>, <em>closed</em> or <em>semi-closed</em>;
<li> whether the object is seekable;
<li> whether buffering is disabled, or enabled on a line or block basis;
<li> a buffer (whose length may be zero).
</ul>

Most handles will also have a current I/O position indicating
where the next input or output operation will occur.
<p>

A handle is <em>readable</em> if it manages only input or both input
and output; likewise, it is <em>writable</em> if it manages only
output or both input and output.  A handle is <em>open</em> when first
allocated.  Once it is closed it can no longer be used for either
input or output, though an implementation cannot re-use its storage
while references remain to it <a href="Rationale.html#Handle-Reuse">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>. <p>

<a name="SemiClosed"><h4>Semi-Closed Handles</h4></a>

The operation <code>hGetContents</code> puts a handle <var>hdl</var> into
an intermediate state, <em>semi-closed</em>.  In this state, <var>hdl</var> is
effectively closed, but items are read from <var>hdl</var> on demand 
and accumulated in a special stream returned
by <code>hGetContents</code> <var>hdl</var>.
 <a href="Rationale.html#getContents">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>
<p>

Any operation except for <code>hClose</code> that fails because a
handle is closed, also fails if a handle is semi-closed.  A
semi-closed handle becomes closed:
<ul>
<li> if 
<a href="#hClose"><code>hClose</code></a> is applied to
it <a href="Rationale.html#Semi-Close-Close">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>;
<li> if an I/O error occurs when reading an item from the
file item from the stream;
<li> or once the entire contents of the file has been read.
</ul>
<p>

Once a semi-closed handle becomes closed, the contents of the
associated stream becomes fixed, and is the list of those items which
were successfully read from that handle. Any I/O errors encountered when
a handle is semi-closed are simply discarded.
 <a href="Rationale.html#Semi-Close-Discard">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>
<p>

<a name="StandardHandles"><h3>Standard Handles</h3></a>

<pre>
> stdin, stdout, stderr :: Handle
</pre><p>

Three handles are allocated during program initialisation .
The first two manage input or output from the Haskell program's
standard input or output channel respectively 
 <a href="Rationale.html#Standard-Handles">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>.  The third manages
output to the standard error channel<a href="Rationale.html#stderr">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>.
These handles are
initially open.
<p>

<a name="OpeningClosing"><h3>Opening and Closing Files</h3></a>

<a name="Opening"><h4>Opening Files</h4></a>

<a href="Rationale.html#Opening-Files">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>
<p>

<pre>
> data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode

> openFile      :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle
</pre><p>

Computation <code>openFile</code> <var>file</var> <var>mode</var> allocates
and returns a new, open handle to manage the file
<var>file</var>.
It manages input if <var>mode</var> is
<code>ReadMode</code>, output if <var>mode</var> is <code>WriteMode</code>
or <code>AppendMode</code>, and both input and output if mode is
<code>ReadWriteMode</code> <a href="Rationale.html#ReadWrite">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>.<p>

If the file does not exist and it is opened for output, it should be
created as a new file.  If <var>mode</var> is <code>WriteMode</code>
and the file already exists, then it should be truncated to zero
length (note: some operating systems delete empty files, so there is
no guarantee that the file will exist following an
<code>openFile</code> with <var>mode</var> <code>WriteMode</code>
unless it is subsequently written to successfully).  The handle is
positioned at the end of the file if <var>mode</var> is
<code>AppendMode</code>, and otherwise at the beginning (in which case
its internal I/O position is 0).  
The initial buffer mode is implementation-dependent.
<p>

The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>PermissionDenied</code><br>
The process has insufficient privileges to perform the operation.
[<code>EACCES</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>EMFILE</code>, <code>ENFILE</code>, <code>EAGAIN</code>]
<li><code>InvalidArgument</code><br>
The operand is not a valid file name.
[<code>ENAMETOOLONG</code>, <code>ELOOP</code>]
<li><code>NoSuchThing</code><br>
The file does not exist.
[<code>ENOENT</code>, <code>ENOTDIR</code>, <code>ENXIO</code>]
<li><code>InappropriateType</code><br>
The path refers to an existing directory.
[<code>EISDIR</code>]
</ul>
<p>
If <code>openFile</code> fails on a file opened for output, the file may 
still have been created if it did not already exist.
<p>
Implementations should enforce, locally to the Haskell process,
multiple-reader single-writer locking on files, which is to say that there may
either be many handles on the same file which manage input, or just one handle on the
file which manages output.
If any open or semi-closed handle is managing a file for
output, no new handle can be allocated for that file.  If any open or
semi-closed handle is managing a file for input, new handles can only
be allocated if they do not manage output.<p>

Two physical files are the same if they have the same absolute name.
An implementation is free to impose stricter conditions.  <a
href="Rationale.html#Locking"> <img src="Rationale.gif"
alt="(Rationale)"></a> <p>

<a name="Closing"><h4>Closing Files</h4></a>

<a name="hClose">
<pre>
> hClose        :: Handle -> IO () 
</pre></a><p>

Computation <code>hClose</code> <var>hdl</var> makes handle
<var>hdl</var> closed.  Before the computation finishes, if <var>hdl</var> is
writable its buffer is flushed as for
<a href="#hFlush"><code>hFlush</code></a>.<p>

The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOSPC</code>]
<li><code>PermissionDenied</code><br>
A resource limit would be exceeded.
[<code>EFBIG</code>]
<li><code>ResourceVanished</code><br>
Buffered data cannot be flushed because of a broken connection.
[<code>EPIPE</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is already closed.
</ul>
<p>

If the operation fails for any reason, any further operations on the 
handle will still fail as for a closed handle.
<p>

<a name="FileSize"><h3>Determining the Size of a File</h3></a>

<pre>
> hFileSize     :: Handle -> IO Integer
</pre><p>

For a handle <var>hdl</var> which attached to a physical file,
<code>hFileSize</code> <var>hdl</var> returns the size of
that file in 8-bit bytes (&gt;= 0).
<p>
The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>InappropriateType</code><br>
The handle is not attached to a physical file.
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is closed.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="EOF"><h3>Detecting the End of Input</h3></a>

<pre>
> hIsEOF        :: Handle -> IO Bool
> isEOF         ::           IO Bool
> isEOF         =  hIsEOF stdin
</pre><p>

For a readable handle <var>hdl</var>, computation <code>hIsEOF</code>
<var>hdl</var> returns <code>True</code> if no further input can be
taken from <var>hdl</var> or for a physical file, if the current I/O
position is equal to the length of the file.  Otherwise, it returns
<code>False</code>. <p>

The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOMEM</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is not open for reading.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="Buffering"><h3>Buffering Operations</h3></a>

Three kinds of buffering are supported: line-buffering, 
block-buffering or no-buffering.  These modes have the following effects.
For output, items are written out from the internal buffer 
according to the buffer mode:
<dl>
<dt>line-buffering<dd>  the entire buffer is written
                        out whenever a newline is output, the buffer overflows, 
                        a flush is issued, or the handle is closed.

<dt>block-buffering<dd> the entire buffer is written out whenever 
                        it overflows, a flush is issued, or the handle
                        is closed.

<dt>no-buffering<dd>    output is written immediately, and never stored
                        in the buffer.
</dl>
The buffer is emptied as soon as it has been written out.
 <a href="Rationale.html#Buffer-Modes">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a>
<p>

Similarly, input occurs according to the buffer mode for handle <var>hdl</var>.
<dl>
<dt>line-buffering<dd>  when the buffer for <var>hdl</var> is not empty,
                        the next item is obtained from the buffer;
                        otherwise, when the buffer is empty,
                        characters up to and including the next newline
                        character are read into the buffer.  No characters
                        are available until the newline character is
                        available.
<dt>block-buffering<dd>  when the buffer for <var>hdl</var> becomes empty,
                        the next block of data is read into the buffer.
<dt>no-buffering<dd>      the next input item is read and returned.
</dl>
<p>
For most implementations, physical files will normally be block-buffered 
and terminals will normally be line-buffered.
<p>

<pre>
> data BufferMode = NoBuffering | LineBuffering | BlockBuffering (Maybe Int)

> hSetBuffering :: Handle -> BufferMode     -> IO ()
</pre><p>

Computation <code>hSetBuffering</code> <var>hdl</var> <var>mode</var> sets the
mode of buffering for handle <var>hdl</var> on subsequent reads and writes.
<ul>
<li>
If <var>mode</var> is <code>LineBuffering</code>, line-buffering is
enabled if possible.
<li>
If <var>mode</var> is <code>BlockBuffering</code> <var>size</var>, then block-buffering
is enabled if possible.  The size of the buffer is <var>n</var> items
if <var>size</var> is <code>Just</code><var>n</var> and is otherwise implementation-dependent.
<li>
If <var>mode</var> is <code>NoBuffering</code>, then buffering is disabled if possible.
</ul><p>

If the buffer mode is changed from <code>BlockBuffering</code> or
<code>LineBuffering</code> to <code>NoBuffering</code>, then 
<ul>
<li>if <var>hdl</var> is writable, the buffer is flushed as for 
<a href="#hFlush"><code>hFlush</code></a>;
<li>if <var>hdl</var> is not writable, the contents of the buffer is discarded.
</ul>
<p>

The default buffering mode when a handle is opened is
implementation-dependent and may depend on the object which is
attached to that handle.<p>
The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOMEM</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is closed.
<li><code>UnsupportedOperation</code><br>
The handle has already been used for reading or writing
and the implementation does not allow the buffering mode to
be changed.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="Flushing"><h4>Flushing Buffers</h4></a>

<a name="hFlush">
<pre>
> hFlush        :: Handle -> IO () 
</pre></a><p>

Computation <code>hFlush</code> <var>hdl</var> causes any items
buffered for output in handle <var>hdl</var> to be sent immediately to
the operating system.  <p>

The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOSPC</code>]
<li><code>PermissionDenied</code><br>
A resource limit would be exceeded.
[<code>EFBIG</code>]
<li><code>ResourceVanished</code><br>
A connection has been broken.
[<code>EPIPE</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is closed, or is not writable.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="Seeking"><h3>Repositioning Handles</h3></a>

<a href="Rationale.html#Seeking">

<p>

<h4>Revisiting an I/O Position</h4>

<pre>
> data HandlePosn

</pre>
<a name ="hGetPosn">
<pre>
> hGetPosn      :: Handle                 -> IO HandlePosn
</pre>
<a name ="hSetPosn">
<pre>
> hSetPosn      :: HandlePosn             -> IO () 
</pre></a><p>

Computation <code>hGetPosn</code> <var>hdl</var> returns the current I/O
position of <var>hdl</var> as an abstract value.  Computation
<code>hSetPosn</code> <var>p</var> sets the position of <var>hdl</var>
to a previously obtained position <var>p</var>.<p>

The computation <code>hSetPosn</code> may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOSPC</code>]
<li><code>PermissionDenied</code><br>
A resource limit would be exceeded.
[<code>EFBIG</code>]
<li><code>ResourceVanished</code><br>
A connection has been broken.
[<code>EPIPE</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is opened in <code>AppendMode</code> or the handle is closed.
<li><code>UnsupportedOperation</code><br>
The handle is not seekable.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Seeking to a new Position</h4>

<pre>
> data SeekMode =  AbsoluteSeek | RelativeSeek | SeekFromEnd
</pre>
<a name="hSeek">
<pre>
> hSeek         :: Handle -> SeekMode -> Integer      -> IO () 
</pre></a><p>

Computation <code>hSeek</code> <var>hdl mode i</var> sets the position of handle
<var>hdl</var> depending on <code>mode</code>.  If <var>mode</var> is
<dl>
<dt><b>AbsoluteSeek</b>
<dd>the position of <var>hdl</var> is set to <var>i</var>.
<dt><b>RelativeSeek</b>
<dd> The position of <var>hdl</var> is set to offset <var>i</var> from
the current position.
<dt><b>SeekFromEnd</b>
<dd> The position of <var>hdl</var> is set to offset <var>i</var> from
the end of the file.
</dl>
The offset is given in terms of 8-bit bytes.
<p>

If <var>hdl</var> is block- or line-buffered, then seeking to a
position which is not in the current buffer will first cause any
items in the output buffer to be written to the device,
and then cause the input buffer to be discarded.
<p>

Some handles may not be seekable (see <a href="Query"><code>hIsSeekable</code></a>), 
or only support a subset of the possible positioning operations
(e.g. it may only be possible to seek to the end of a tape, or to a
positive offset from the beginning or current position).<p>

It is not possible to set a negative I/O position, or for a physical
file, an I/O position beyond the current end-of-file.
<p>
The computation may fail with:
<ul>
<li><code>HardwareFault</code><br>
A physical I/O error has occurred.
[<code>EIO</code>]
<li><code>ResourceExhausted</code><br>
Insufficient resources are available to perform the operation.
[<code>ENOSPC</code>]
<li><code>PermissionDenied</code><br>
A resource limit would be exceeded.
[<code>EFBIG</code>]
<li><code>ResourceVanished</code><br>
A connection has been broken.
[<code>EPIPE</code>]
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is opened in <code>AppendMode</code> or the handle is closed.
<li><code>UnsupportedOperation</code><br>
The handle is not seekable.
</ul>
<p>

<a name="Query"><h3>Handle Properties</h3></a>

<pre>
> hIsOpen          :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsClosed        :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsReadable      :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsWritable      :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsBlockBuffered :: Handle -> IO (Bool,Maybe Int)
> hIsLineBuffered  :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsNotBuffered   :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsSeekable      :: Handle -> IO Bool
</pre><p>

A number of operations return information about the properties of a
handle.  Each of these operations 
except <code>hIsBlockBuffered</code> returns <code>True</code> if the handle 
has the specified property,
and <code>False</code> otherwise. <a href="Rationale.html#Properties">
<img src="Rationale.gif" alt="(Rationale)"></a> <p>

Computation <code>hIsBlockBuffered</code> <var>hdl</var> returns
<code>( False, Nothing )</code> if <var>hdl</var> is not block-buffered.
Otherwise it returns <code>( True, </code><var>size</var><code> )</code>,
where <var>size</var> is <code>Nothing</code> for default buffering,
and <code>( Just </code><var>n</var><code> )</code> for block-buffering
of <var>n</var> 8-bit bytes.<p>

Any of the latter six computations may fail with
<ul>
<li><code>IllegalOperation</code><br>
The handle is closed.
</ul>
