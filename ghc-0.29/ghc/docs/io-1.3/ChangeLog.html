<!--     [HMTL doesn't seem to allow links from pre-formatted text, -->
<!--      so definitions can't be properly linked-->
<!--      to the correct module.  What a mess this system is.]-->
<!--	Check out LINK and REL (not supported?). -->

<dt>941130
<dd> Major revision to separate core and non-core functionality,
     and to enhance portability based on long-term feedback.
<br> Removed the separation between primitive and derived
     values -- this was confusing, and not really useful.
<br> Fixed HTML errors to allow code to be previewed
     on all platforms.
