<a name="General"><h2>General</h2></a>

The proposal (like most of Haskell) is supposed to be rather boring.
It provides a basic interface to common operating systems such as
Unix, DOS, VMS, or the Macintosh, but does not address future
operating systems, include ones based on object-orientation or
persistence, or even graphical interface issues.  Like other aspects
of the Haskell design, it is somewhat more exciting than might be
imagined, since it represents an attempt to provide
"industrial-strength" input/output in a purely functional context.
Other languages which have tried to do something like this are 
<a href="Biblio.html#Hope+">Hope+</a>
and <a href="Biblio.html#Clean">Clean</a>.
<p>

<a name="Non-Determinism"><h3>Non-Determinism</h3></a>

I/O is not deterministic.  That is, the same program
could have different results when run multiple times (for example
if a user gives different input from the keyboard).  This is a
requirement for real-world interaction.
<p>

The Haskell language is, however, both deterministic and referentially
transparent.  This apparent contradiction is resolved because I/O
operations exist outside the language.  Typically, a Haskell program
is one process in a side-effecting operating system.  The operating
system affects the environment that the Haskell program exists in, and
may respond to the result produced by that program (a series of
monadic values>) by side-effecting the environment and returning the
result as an input to the program.  Internally, however, all
expressions in the Haskell program are free from side-effect (including those
of type <code>IO a</code>).  
<p>

<a name="Libraries"><h3>Libraries</h3></a>

In Haskell 1.3, Library modules are
distinguished from Prelude modules in order to avoid cluttering the
name space with infrequently used names, and also so that
implementations can avoid loading unreferenced names.  This should
help produce faster translators and smaller binaries.<p>

<a name="Conformance"><h3>Conformance</h3></a>

Two levels of conformance are defined so
that programmers can rely on exact portability between
<em>strictly-conforming</em> Haskell implementations, while allowing
implementation flexibility on systems where some operations are
unnatural, or difficult to implement.  Documentation of
non-conformance, and of all implementation dependencies, is required
so that programmers know exactly how their program will behave without
needing to test it under each new implementation.<p>

<a name="Compatibility"><h3>Compatibility with Haskell 1.2</h3></a>

The goal of strict backwards compatibility was abandoned in favour of
a more compact, more flexible approach to I/O.  Existing
implementations are encouraged to continue to provide Haskell 1.2 I/O
functions where possible, but new programs should be written using
Haskell 1.3 operations.
<p>

<a name="Conversion"><h4>Converting Existing Programs</h4></a>

Most existing Haskell programs written using continuation-passing
style or streams should be easily convertible to monadic I/O.
<p>

The following operations which were supported in Haskell 1.2
are not supported in Haskell 1.3:
<ul>
<li> Binary files
<li> Echoing control
<li> Channels as distinct entities from files
<li> File and channel status operations
<li> Setting environment variables
</ul>
<p>

<a name="Omissions"><h3>Omissions</h3></a>

There is a tension between providing enough functionality to allow
sensible applications to be written, and providing a reasonably
compact, easily implemented I/O system.  This definition is intended
to provide the functionality that most students or practising
functional programmers are likely to need.
<p>

Here are some of the I/O operations that were considered, but which were
not included in the final definition.
<ul>
<li> Determining file existence
<li> Controlling file access permissions and locks
<li> Truncating a file
<li> Merging input from multiple handles
<li> General interrupt handling
<li> File information operations
<li> Process control primitives
<li> Binary file operations
<li> Terminal control (echoing etc.) 
<li> Setting environment variables
<li> Synchronising disks
<li> Asynchronous I/O operations
<li> Indexed file access
<li> More primitive monadic operations (GHC's <code>IO</code>)
<li> Parsing primitives based on <code>read</code>
<li> Interlanguage working
<li> Spawning lazy computations
<li> Creating fixpoints
<li> Mutable variables
</ul>
<p>


<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeIO"><h2>PreludeIO</h2></a>

<a name="interact"><h3>interact</h3></a>

<a href="PreludeIO.html#interact"><code>interact</code></a> was provided in Haskell
1.2 as a way to write simple I/O programs as functions from input
strings to output strings.  This emulates the functionality provided
by many previous functional languages, such as SASL.
<p>

<em>Example</em>: a program to replace all lower-case letters with their
upper-case equivalents.
<p>
<pre>
> main = interact (map toUpper)
</pre>
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeMonadicIO"><h2>PreludeMonadicIO</h2></a>

<a name="error"><h3>Use of fail rather than error</h3></a>
<code>error</code> aborts the program without giving any opportunity
to recover from the error.  It can be used in <em>any</em> type of
expression.  <code>fail</code> allows the error to be handled if
appropriate, using operations such as <a
href="PreludeMonadicIO.html#handle"><code>handle</code></a> and <a
href="PreludeMonadicIO.html#try"><code>try</code></a> but can only be used
in expressions of type <code>IO a</code>.  <p>

<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeIOError"><h2>PreludeIOError</h2></a>

This module tries to identify all errors which might arise when
performing the I/O operations defined in the standard.  It is much
more informative than Haskell 1.2 in that it gives specific names to
errors rather than relying on the general classes
<code>ReadError</code>, <code>WriteError</code>, etc.  This allows
meaningful handlers to be written which are not
implementation-dependent.

<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeStdIO"><h2>PreludeStdIO</h2></a>

The module is defined in terms of items read from a handle, rather
than characters, to allow the possibility of reading structured files
in an extended implementation.  <a
href="PreludeReadTextIO.html"><code>PreludeReadTextIO</code></a> and
<a href="PreludeWriteTextIO.html"><code>PreludeWriteTextIO</code></a> provide
read and write operations for handles operating on steams of
characters.
<p>

<a name="Handle-Reuse"><h3>Handle Reuse</h3></a>

If an implementation reused a handle after it was closed while there
where still implicit references to it from within the functional program,
then the I/O semantics could be subverted, and cause non-intuitive
results.  For example, in
<p>
<pre>
> openFile ReadMode "foo" >>= \ foo ->
> hClose foo              >>
> openFile ReadMode "bar" >>= \ bar ->
> hGetChar foo
</pre><p>
if handle <code>foo</code> was reused for <code>bar</code>, then
this code sequence would return the first character in <code>"bar"</code>
rather than raising an error.  This is therefore prohibited by the
language semantics.
<p>

<a name="Semi-closing"><h3>Semi-Closing</h3></a>

Semi-closing is used to emulate the lazy stream reading found in
almost all functional languages.
<p>

<a name="Semi-Close-Discard">Errors are discarded</a> on a
semi-closed handle because it is not possible to handle them!  The
value read from the semi-closed handle is fixed as a list of items,
but in order to raise an error this would need to be a list of
<code>IO</code> items.  Using such a type would defeat the purpose of
having semi-closed streams, which is to model lazy stream reading
by returning a list of items from that stream.
<p>

Normally semi-closed handles will be closed automatically when the
contents of the associated stream have been read completely.
<a name="Semi-Close-Close">
Occasionally, the programmer may want to force a semi-closed handle to be closed</a>
before this happens, by using <code>hClose</code> (e.g. if an error occurs
when reading a handle, or if the entire contents is not needed but the
file must be overwritten with a new value).  In this case, the
implementation defines exactly which characters have been read from
the handle and which are frozen as the contents of the handle.
<p>

<a name="Standard-Handles"><h3>Standard Handles</h3></a>

Most operating systems provide a notion of standard program input and
output.  For interactive text-based programs, these are normally
connected to the user's keyboard.  Operating systems which do not
have this concept (such as the Macintosh) are normally graphics-based.
In such a system, it does not make sense to have a text-based program,
unless some primitive text emulation is performed.  Since, however, the
majority of operating systems are still text-based, and it is unclear
how to standardise a set of portable windowing operations for the
graphics-based systems, the notion of standard input, output and
error handles has been retained.
<p>

<a name="stderr">The <code>stderr</code> handle</a> is provided because it is often useful
to separate error output from normal user output on
<code>stdout</code>.  In operating systems which support this, one or
the other is often directed into a file.  If an operating system
doesn't distinguish between user and error output, a sensible
default is for the two names to refer to the same handle.
<p>

<a name="Opening-Files"><h3>Opening Files</h3></a>

The <code>openFile</code> operation proved surprisingly controversial,
and difficult to specify.  In the interests of simplicity and
portability, a single high-level <code>openFile</code> has been
provided.  It would be possible to separate this into simpler
operations (such as <code>open</code>,<code> create</code>,<code>
truncate</code>,<code> lock</code>,<code> seek</code>,<code>
setAccessRights</code>, etc. etc.), but this would be awkward to use, and
probably non-portable.
Programmers should use the relevant operating-system specific bindings
if they require these lower levels of file access.
<p>

<a name="OpenBinary"><h4>Text/Binary Files</h4></a>

The definition doesn't distinguish text and binary file types.  Files
should be opened in the appropriate mode whenever possible.  On some
systems the operations permitted on the two types of file are
different, but the file types are distinguished by convention rather
than by the operating system.  For these systems, it is important to
specify whether a file is opened as in text or binary mode.
In these cases, we recommend that the implementation introduces an extension,
providing an additional <code>openBinaryFile</code> operation with the
same parameters and results as <code>openFile</code>.  If this
proves sufficiently useful, and general, it will be promoted to the
core definition.
<p>

<a name="ReadWrite"><h4>ReadWrite Mode</h4></a>

It has been argued that this mode is not necessary, but many useful
applications are impossible to write otherwise.  Perhaps existing
functional programmers only write compilers or similar functions
from streams to streams?  If a file is large and changes are
small, however, it is much more efficient to make a small incremental
change than to copy an entire file.
<p>

An on-screen interactive text editor is an example of an application
where this mode is useful (it is possible to write editors which work
on streams, but they can be unpleasant to use!), and there are many
business examples.  Providing this mode significantly extends the
range of Haskell applications that can be written at almost no
implementation cost.  It is rare to find a modern operating system
that does not provide this kind of access directly.  <p>

<a name="Locking"><h4>File Locking</h4></a>

A consistent problem with Haskell 1.2 was that implementations were
not required to lock files when they where opened.  Consequently, if a
program reopened a file for writing while it was still being read, the
results returned from the read could be garbled.  Because of lazy
evaluation and implicit buffering (also not specified by Haskell 1.2),
it was possible for this to happen on some but not all program
executions.  This problem only occurs with languages which implement
lazy stream input (<a
href="PreludeReadTextIO.html#hGetContents"><code>hGetContents</code></a>)
and also have non-strict semantics.  <p>

It has been argued that programmers should avoid opening a file when
it has already been opened in an incompatible way.  Unfortunately, in
general, this is difficult or even impossible to do -- almost all
non-trivial programs open user-supplied filenames, and there is often
no way of telling from the names whether two filenames refer to the
same file.  The only safe thing to do is implement file locks whenever
a file is opened.  This could be done by the programmer if a suitable locking
operation was provided, but to be secure this would need to be done on
every <code>openFile</code> operation, and might also require knowledge
of the operating system.
<p>

The definition requires that identical files are locked against
accidental overwriting within a single Haskell program (single-writer,
multiple-reader).  Two physical files are certainly identical if they
have the same filename, but may be identical in other circumstances.
A good implementation will use operating-system level locking
(mandatory or advisory), if they are appropriate, to protect the
user's data files.  Even so, the definition <em>only</em> requires an
implementation to take precautions to avoid obvious and persistent
problems due to lazy file I/O (a language feature): it does not
require the implementation to protect against interference by other
applications or the operating system itself.  <strong>Caveat
user</strong>.  <p>

<a name="FileSize"><h3>File Sizes</h3></a>

The file size is given as an integral number of bytes.  On some operating
systems, it is possible
that this will not be an accurate indication of the number of characters
that can be read from the file.
<p>

<a name="Extents"><h4>File Extents</h4></a>

On some systems (e.g. the Macintosh), it is much more efficient to
define the maximum size of a file (or extent) when it is created, and
to increase this extent by the total number of bytes written if the
file is appended to, rather than increasing the file size each time a
block of data is written.  This may allow a file to be laid out
contiguously on disk, for example, and therefore accessed more
efficiently.  In any case, the actual file size will be no greater than the extent.
<p>

While efficient file access is a desirable characteristic, the
designers felt that dealing with this aspect of I/O led to a design
which was over-complex for the normal programmer.  The core Haskell
I/O definition therefore does not distinguish between file size (the
number of bytes in the file), and file extent (the amount of disk
occupied by a file).  <p>

<a name="End-of-file"><h3>End of File</h3></a>

There are two alternative ways of detecting end-of-file, either by
testing using <a href="PreludeStdIO.html#EOF"><code>hIsEOF</code></a> or
by handling the <code>EOF</code> error after a <code>getChar</code> or
similar operation.  While this may seem redundant, end-of-file
detection often has algorithmic implications.  This design allows
error handlers to be reserved for unusual or unexpected situations.
<p>

<a name="Buffering"><h3>Buffering</h3></a>

Buffering interacts with many of the operations provided here.  While
it might seem desirable to eliminate this complexity, for correct I/O
semantics it is sometimes necessary to specify that a device should
not be buffered, or that it should have a particular buffer size.  In
the absence of such strict buffering semantics, it can also be
difficult to reason (even informally) about the contents of a file
following a series of interacting I/O operations.
<p>

While it would be sufficient to provide <a href="#hFlush"><code>hFlush</code></a>, this
would be tedious to use (for any kind of buffering other than
<code>BlockBuffering</code>), error-prone, and would
require programmers to cooperate by providing optional flushing after
each I/O operations when writing library functions.
<p>

<a name="Buffer-Modes"><h4>Buffer Modes</h4></a>

The three buffer modes mirror those provided by <a
href="Biblio.html#ANSI-C">ANSI C</a>.  The programmer should normally
accept the buffering modes that the implementation chooses as default.
<p>

<a name="Seeking"><h3>Changing the I/O position</h3></a>

Many applications need direct access to files if they are
to be implemented efficiently.  Examples are text editors,
or simple database applications.  It is surprising how
complicated such a common and apparently simple operation as changing
the I/O position is in practice.  The design given here draws
heavily on the <a href="Biblio.html#ANSI-C">ANSI C standard</a>.
<p>

<a name="hGetPosn"><h4>Revisiting an I/O position</h4></a>

On some operating systems or devices, it is not possible to seek to
arbitrary locations, but only to ones which have previously been
visited.  For example, if newlines in text files are represented by
pairs of characters (as in DOS), then the I/O position will not be the
same as the number of characters which have been read from the file up
to that point and absolute seeking is not sensible.  
<a href="PreludeStdIO.html#hGetPosn>
<code>hGetPosn</code></a> and <a href="PreludeStdIO.html#hSetPosn>
<code>hSetPosn</code></a> together provide this functionality, using
an abstract type to represent the positioning information (which may
be an <code>Integer</code> or any other suitable type).
Note that there is no way to convert a <code>handlePosn</code> into
an <code>Integer</code> offset.  Since this is not generally possible,
and it is not normally difficult for a programmer to record the current
I/O position if using <code>hSeek</code>,
on balance the designers felt that this should be omitted.
<pre>
> toOffset :: HandlePosn -> Integer
</pre>
<p>

<a name="hSeek"><h4>Seeking to a new I/O position</h4></a>

Other operating systems (such as Unix or the Macintosh) allow I/O at
any position in a file.  The <a
href="PreludeStdIO.html#hSeek"><code>hSeek</code></a> operation
allows three kinds of positioning: absolute positioning, positioning
relative to the current I/O position, and positioning relative
to the current end-of-file.  Some implementations may only support
some of these operations.
<p>

All positioning offsets are an integral number of bytes.  This seems
to be fairly widely supported and is quite simple.  The alternatives
(e.g. defining positioning in terms of the number of items which
can be read from the file)
seem to give designs which are difficult both to understand and to use.
<p>

<a name="Properties"><h3>Handle Properties</h3></a>

The original Haskell 1.3 design provided a single operation to return
all the properties of a handle.  This proved to be very unwieldy, and
would also have been difficult to extend to cover other properties
(since Haskell does not have named records).
The operation was therefore split into many component operations,
one for each property that a handle must have (determining the I/O position
is <a href="#hGetPosn> treated separately</a>).
<p>

Note that while there are <code>hIsOpen</code> and <code>hIsClosed</code> operations,
there is no way to test whether a
handle is semi-closed.  This was felt to be of marginal utility for
most programmers, and is easy to define if necessary.  
<p>
<pre>
> hIsSemiClosed     :: Handle -> IO Bool
> hIsSemiClosed h   =  hIsOpen h                 >>= \ ho ->
>                      hIsClosed h               >>= \ hc ->
>                      return (not (ho || hc))
</pre>
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeReadTextIO"><h2>PreludeReadTextIO</h2></a>

<a name="hReady"><h3>Checking for Input</h3></a>

<code>hReady</code> is intended to help write interactive programs or
ones which manage multiple input streams.  Because it is non-blocking,
this can lead to serious inefficiency if it is used to poll several
handles.
<p>

One solution is to define an operation based on Unix <code>select</code>.
<pre>
> type SelectData = ([Handle], [Handle], [Handle], Maybe Integer)
> select :: SelectData -> IO (Maybe SelectData)
</pre>
<p>

<code>SelectData</code> consists of three sets of handles (which need
not be disjoint) and an optional time interval.<p>

Computation <code>select</code> (<var>ihs</var>, <var>ohs</var>, <var>ehs</var>,
<var>mb</var>) waits until input is possible on at least one member
of 
<var>ihs</var>, output is available on at least one member of <var>ohs</var>
or an exceptional condition arises on at least one member of <var>ehs</var>.
All handles in the sets which meet the specified conditions are returned.
If a timeout is given (<var>mb</var> is
<code>Just</code> <var>i</var>) the computation waits at most <var>i</var> nanoseconds
before timing out; in which case it returns <code>Nothing</code>.
Otherwise, the time remaining before the timeout would occur is returned
as the fourth component of the result (<code>Nothing</code> if no timeout was given).
<p>

<a name="Lookahead"><h3>Reading Ahead</h3></a>

It can be useful to examine the next character in the input stream
when writing a lexical analyser or similar input-processing function.
The functionality of <a href="Biblio.html#Ada9x">Ada's</a> <code>lookAhead</code> was 
preferred over that
of <a href="Biblio.html#ANSI-C">ANSI C's</a> <code>ungetc</code> because 
it is much less problematic
to implement.  Compared with Modula-3's <code>unGetChar</code>,
this definition avoids needing to record in each handle whether the last I/O
operation was a <code>getChar</code>.  Even so, it is not entirely 
cost-free: a one-character buffer must be provided even
for unbuffered handles.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="PreludeWriteTextIO"><h2>PreludeWriteTextIO</h2></a>

There seems to be much less controversy over character-level output
than input, and therefore no rationale is provided.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="LibDirectory"><h2>LibDirectory</h2></a>

No status operations are provided.
Haskell 1.2 <code>statusFile</code>/<code>statusChan</code> were
rarely, if ever, used.  Their functionality is probably better
provided by operating-system specific operations, which can give
more exact information.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="LibSystem"><h2>LibSystem</h2></a>

<a name="ExitCodes"><h3>Exit Codes</h3></a>

Only <code>ExitSuccess</code> and <code>ExitFailure</code> are
available.  Some operating systems may wish to test whether a program
failed due to an unhandled interrupt.  This is best done using an
operating-system specific routine, such as those provided in the POSIX
binding <a href="Posix.html"><code>LibPosix</code></a>.
<p>

<a name="getEnv"><h3>Environment Variables</h3></a>

<code>getEnv</code> is generally available in most operating
systems in some form or other.  When available it provides
a useful way of communicating infrequently-changed information to a program
(which it is inconvenient to specify on the command-line for shell-based
systems).
Setting environment variables is a much less common feature. Although
this can be highly useful when available, it is therefore not provided
as part of the core definition.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="LibTime"><h2>LibTime</h2></a>

This library codifies existing practice in the shape of the
<code>Time</code> library provided by <code>hbc</code>.  Unlike that
library it is not Unix-specific, and it provides recognised support
for international time standards, including time-zone information.
Time differences are recorded in a meaningful datatype rather
than as a double-precision number.
<p>

There are two obvious ways to specify subseconds.  <code>hbc</code>
has chosen to use a <code>Double</code> to represent fractions of
a second.  Because of limitations on floating-point accuracy, this is 
potentially unacceptable if these values are actually significant (for example
if they are used to timestamp similarly-timed stock-market transactions).
Since Haskell does not define the precision of <code>Double</code>, it is
also not clear that double-precision values are sufficiently accurate for
sub-second timings.
<p>

An <code>Integer</code> has therefore been used instead.
Subseconds are specified to picosecond precision (but not necessarily
accuracy!), which should be more than accurate enough for the forseeable
future.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="LibCPUTime"><h2>LibCPUTime</h2></a>

<code>getCPUTime</code> is specified to nanosecond precision, since
this is the precision used by the most accurate existing clocks that
are in common use.  Note that while OSF/1 for the DEC Alpha specifies
timings to nanosecond precision, the times returned are only accurate
to around 1ms.
<p>

<hr><p>
<a name="LibUserInterrupt"><h2>LibUserInterrupt</h2></a>

User-produced interrupts are the most important class of interrupt
which programmers commonly want to handle.  Almost all platforms,
including small systems such as Macintosh and DOS, provide some ability
to generate user-produced interrupts.
