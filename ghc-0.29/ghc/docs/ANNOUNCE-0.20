This is version 0.20 of the Glorious Glasgow Haskell compilation
system (GHC).

Version 0.20 is an "internal" release, intended *ONLY* for the most
fanatical GHC hackers.

* Many things about it may be broken, though it
does compile and run most programs.

* I/O and ccall scheme re-done; any such low-level code probably needs
  fixing; I/O attempts to follow 1.3 I/O proposal.  All ccall
  arguments and results are automagically "boxed".

* PrimOps fiddled; any code that uses them directly will probably need
  attention.

* We've renamed some things, so as to move to a we-don't-steal-user-
  name-space policy.  Thus "tagCmp" has become "_tagCmp".  Names starting
  with underscores are now cool if -fglasgow-exts.

  You might want to see our "state-interface" document if you mess
  with all this low-level/non-standard stuff; I'll try to remember to
  put a copy up for FTP.

* No promises about profiling.

* Documentation is untouched since 0.19.

Version 0.19 was the last public release.  It has held up pretty well
and should be available wherever you got 0.20 from.  I commend 0.19 to
all sane people.

Configuring 0.20 is a little different than 0.19:

    % cd <very-top>
    % ./configure --with-boot=c
    % ./STARTUP-ghc std
    % cd ghc; make

Things to note:

* It's wrong for jmake to tell you "0: unknown flag -traditional"; but
  it is harmless.

* The 0.20 compiler seems more likely to run out of stack; use
  -Rmax-stksize2m (or something) to increase; within the distribution,
  probably something like...

    % make EXTRA_HC_OPTS="-H20m -Rmax-stksize4m"

See the "configure" script if you want to know what other options are
-- there is no other documentation at this time!
