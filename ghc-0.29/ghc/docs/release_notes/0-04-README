Version 0.04 of the new Glasgow Haskell compiler was yet another
unannounced release for our friends at York (and elswhere).

----------------------------------------------------------------
91/11/01:

2 notes: [1] "main" should no longer have the non-std type "Int"; instead,
it should have the non-std type "IOPrim"!  (We're creeping towards
real Haskell I/O.)  compiler/tests/codeGen/cg001/Main.hs is a New
Improved "main", I believe.  docs/io-design may also be useful.
[2] The old "import MiniPrel" trick has changed (and will change
again).  Because we're in the middle of trying to get full/original
names going, you have to use one or more MODULE-SPECIFIC
"MiniPrel*.hi" files; they're in lib/prelude.
