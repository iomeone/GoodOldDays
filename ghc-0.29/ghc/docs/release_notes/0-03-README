Version 0.03 of the new Glasgow Haskell compiler was an unannounced
(exceedingly unpolished) release for our friends at York.

-------------------------------------

A quick list of things to note:

* Significantly different parser (parsers/hsp/) and reader
  (compiler/reader/), to do Haskell 1.1 syntax.  The abstract syntax
  (compiler/abstractSyn/) now covers the entire Haskell language.

* Compiler files have been majorly shuffled, renamed, in part to
  ensure filenames are <= 14 chars.  Another such catastrophic
  re-shuffle is unlikely for the foreseeable future.

  The file docs/FILE-RENAMING is a fairly complete list of
  what-changed-to-what.

* Pretty-printing machinery (compiler/utils/{Pretty,Outputable}.lhs)
  is completely changed.

* Identifiers are now "Ids" (compiler/basicTypes/Id.lhs), not "Locals"
  or "Globals".

* What-the-compiler-must-know-about-the-prelude (compiler/prelude) is
  believed to be complete; this includes Chars, Ints, Floats, and
  Doubles as primitives.
  
  (Stuff for Integers and Rationals is NOT all there.)

  All other prelude stuff should be specifiable w/ an ordinary
  interface file (notably lib/prelude/MiniPrel.hi).

* The compiler does full-blown overloading of expressions and
  patterns.  Yell if this really won't do -- perhaps a build-time
  option to override?

* All flavours of patterns and expressions (e.g., n+k patterns,
  arithmetic sequences) are in; testing in some cases near zero.

* BUGS INEVITABLE, MAJOR BUGS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, PATCHES WILL PROBABLY
  BE REQUIRED.  Don't panic, report promptly!

* "main"'s (main/Main.lhs) handling of command-line options [and the
  feeding of same by the driver, driver/ghc.lprl] has been revised.

* Documentation has _not_ been updated.
