Herein are bits of documentation for, or related to, the Glorious
Glasgow Haskell compilation system.  Unless specified otherwise, they
are nestled in the ghc/docs directory of the distribution.

== semi-proper documentation ==========================================

install_guide/*
	A step-by-step guide on how to configure, build, and install
	the system.

users_guide/*
	The User's Guide for the system.  Describes how to "drive" the
	system, how to deal with common problems, how to use the
	profiling tools, what is Known to be Broken, how to use the
	Glasgow extensions, etc.

release_notes/*
	Release notes for the system. What's new in each release, and
	what's coming Real Soon Now.

io-1.3/*
	The *draft* Haskell 1.3 I/O proposal at December 1994.  In
	HTML format.  Unstructured.html gives you the whole thing in
	one big wad.

state-interface.dvi
	"GHC prelude: types and operations", an addendum to the Peyton
	Jones/Launchbury "state" paper, is the definitive reference
	(bar the compiler source :-) of GHC's lowest-level interfaces
	(primitive ops, etc.).

add_to_compiler/paper.dvi
	An overview of how to add a piece to the compiler.

simple-monad.lhs
	A *simple* introduction to the common use of monads in Haskell
	programming.  No fancy stuff whatsoever.  By Will Partain.

../../mkworld/docs/mkworld_guide/*
	A guide to the ``make world'' configuration system ... ``for
	the brave.''  The "configure" script (versions 0.22ff) make
	this a little less visible than before.

../../literate/doc/*
	The documentation for the ``literate programming'' stuff, if
	you're interested.

== relevant papers and abstracts ======================================

Consult ghc/docs/abstracts/abstracts<year>.tex for information about
Glasgow work related to the GHC system.  Other relevant material is
listed here.  All of it is available by FTP.

Haskell report, version 1.2 (the latest)
	It was in your May, 1992, SIGPLAN Notices.  Not in the
	distribution but in ~ftp/pub/haskell/report/ (the usual
	places).

Haskell tutorial, by Paul Hudak and Joe Fasel
	Ditto.  In ~ftp/pub/haskell/tutorial/; usual places.

== notes and things ===================================================

NOTES.* Random collections of notes on topics *.  Check the
	modification dates to see what's new...  Don't believe
	everything you read.

MAIL*	Files holding some relevant correspondence.

README files
	A few of these actually exist and tell the truth.
