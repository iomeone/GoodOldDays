Library code for Glorious Glasgow Haskell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Library code" is written in (possibly Glasgow-extended) Haskell.  If
it has to be written in C, it's in ../runtime.

"tests" is supposed to be, well, tests.

"prelude" and "glaExts" hold the standard and not-so-standard Prelude
code; you get this stuff, like it or not.

"std", "hbc" and "ghc" (and eventually "yale", etc., etc?) are
libraries of useful modules.  The idea is: once all implementers agree
on a module, it goes in "std"; otherwise, it lives in an
implementation-specific library.

Still in development.
