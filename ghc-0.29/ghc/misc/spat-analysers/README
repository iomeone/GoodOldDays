This directory (ghc/misc/spat-analysers) includes the source for
"analysers" to use with the SPAT (SPARC Performance Analysis Tools?)
system, which includes "shade", "shadow", and "spixtools".

The analysers here are no actual use to you unless you have the SPAT
system from Sun.  Bob Cmelik was the ringleader at Sun for quite
some time.  The current person to contact about it is:
	
	John Rodriguez
	Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Inc.
	2550 Garcia Avenue, MS 29-225
	Mountain View, CA 94043
	(415) 336-1709
        john.rodriguez@sun.com

We are supplying these analysers so you can see the Cool Things you
can do with them, in the hope that you will be motivated to build upon
our work.
