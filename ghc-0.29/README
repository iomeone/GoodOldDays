This is the root directory for functional-programming tools
distributed by the Computing Science Department at Glasgow University.
Simon Peyton Jones <simonpj@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk> is the ringleader
of this effort.  The tools are:

    ghc		the Glasgow Haskell compilation system
    haggis	the Haggis GUI toolkit
    happy	the Happy Haskell parser generator
    nofib	the NoFib Haskell benchmarking suite
    literate	the Glasgow "literate programming" system
    mkworld	configuration system (derived from X11 imake)
    glafp-utils shared utility programs

The "literate" stuff is usually distributed *with* other systems, but
not necessarily.  Components which are always part of a distribution
(never stand-alone) are "glafp-utils" and "mkworld" (a configuration
system).

There is usually an ANNOUNCE* file with any distribution.  Please
consult that, or the <piece>/README file, to find out how to proceed.
