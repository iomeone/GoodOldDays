This is a hacked version of the std GNU `info' and `makeinfo'.
The last version compared against was in the texinfo-2.15 package.

The version of Dave Gillespie's info.el is 1.05; it's *great*!

"makeinfo" is the only pgm which we've mangled significantly.  The
diffs vs the GNU-distributed `makeinfo' and our "enhancements", both
turned on by #defines:

* -DALLOW_JUNK puts the text of unrecognized commands through (vs
   tossed away)

* -DTRACK_SRCFILE puts in additional commands @srcfile and @srclineno,
  which try to allow tracking of the original src file (assuming the
  .texinfo file was generated from something else).
