This directory (and its subdirectories) contains version 0.26 of the
Glasgow literate programming system.  This stuff is usually -- but not
always -- distributed as part of a larger system (e.g., the Glasgow
Haskell compiler).

The version numbers for this system tend to track those for Glasgow
Haskell, even if virtually nothing has changed herein.

Version 0.26 has a few bug fixes since 0.16 (and earlier versions),
plus some "lit2html" code contributed by Chris Toshok
<toshok@cs.uidaho.edu>.  Way cool stuff!  (HTML is the Hypertext
Markup Language, used on the World-Wide Web.)

Version 0.26 is virtually the same as version 0.19.  It has one
or two "lit2html" fixes.

The subdirectory "doc" contains the user's guide (notably, the files
literate.dvi [TeX-produced DVI format] and literate.info [equivalent
in GNU Info format].

If you are building/installing this stuff as a separate system, please
consult the relevant section of the user's guide, near the end
(source: literate/doc/install.lit).  If this stuff "came with" another
system (e.g., GHC or NoFib), simply follow the directions for
building/installing *that* system.

Once this system is built, if you would like to see its source in
"literate" form (not overly recommended :-), try:

    % cd <here>
    % make depend	    # may be omitted if you've already done it
    % make lit2stuff.dvi
		# or...
    % make lit2stuff.info

The subdirectory "info-utils" contains hacked versions of the GNU
Info-related utilities, "info" and "makeinfo".  See the README file
there.

Comments about and suggestions for this system would be most welcome.
You may send them directly to me.
