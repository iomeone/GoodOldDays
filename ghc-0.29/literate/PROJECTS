de-Birdizing for >#(if|elsif|else|endif)

Haskell same-named codethings from diff namespaces

\title as \section0 ?

for large docs, could use
\reset{indexing,xref}tables to be heaved in periodically.

chg onlyinfo, onlylatex semantics to go straight-through.

onlystandalone, etc.: carry both through, decide on linking

how does CPP interact w/ haskell?

independent code writing / code printing styles.

xtex option?

\begin...\end{invisiblecode}

(info) be able to jump to all places where a function is used

postmakeinfo -- colons in nodenames

index the right things

pagebreaks for code in LaTeX

verbatim in verbatim (cf verbatim.sty)

math mode

and what's this with @'s in codeformat (if the latter exists?!)

multiple indexes -- we need these! (e.g., code for subsystems of a
larger system don't want to share an index):
    \index[string]{index-entry-as-usual} % default is "main" index
    \printindex[string] % default is "main" index
also
    \setcurrentindex{string} % to change default
    \setcurrentcodeindex{string} % where code-ish index-entries go
Implementation: I'd pre-pend the string to the entry-as-usual
("string<uniquifier>!"), let LaTeX/makeinfo do the work, then
post-process to make the separate indexes.

Got a bug with:

    Used only once (ToDo: check ?):
       <- spaces here
    >newTyVar :: NFSap TyVar

ditto for \tr{\Haskell}... (defined things)

if lit2pgm fails, nuke the output file (so make will re-try).
