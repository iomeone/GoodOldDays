This directory tree's worth of stuff are utility bits that are used in
more than one of the Glasgow functional-programming tools.  (For the
project-specific bits, try <project>/utils/<blah>.)

etags/		A variant of the common Emacs tags-generating program.

msub/		a utility from Paul DuBois, that lets you substitute
		for make variables (e.g., $(CC) ) in any old document.
		Given that, with the "make world" configuration
		system, Makefiles have loads of useful config info in
		them, this is the program used to sneak that info into
		other files.

verbatim/	A LaTeX pre-processor that some people like, namely
		Simon PJ.  Provides shorthand for common LaTeX
		constructs that he uses.

scripts/	little utility scripts

 fastmake	a "make" wrapper for compiling Haskell programs;
		essentially, strips out the "make depend"ed
		dependencies to avoid so much re-checking.

 lndir		from X imake stuff (via DuBois); make a shadow tree
		of symbolic links

 ltx		a "latex" wrapper.  Re-runs latex/bibtex/makeindex
		enough times to "do the right thing."

 mkdependC	script version of C makedepend (from X11R4 via DuBois)

 mkdirhier	"mkdir a/b/c/d" will do "mkdir a; mkdir a/b; ..."
		(assuming none of those dirs exist)

 perltags	"etags" for Perl.

 runstdtest	runs a pgm with some flags & some stdin; checks for an
		expected exit code, expected stdout, and expected
		stderr.  (Expect this to change :-)

 zap-if-same	Zap files in this directory (and subdirectories) if
		they are identical to files in the given directory
		(and its subdirectories).  With -s, it replaces the
		files here with symlinks to the files there.
